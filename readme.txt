In the MULTISIM simulation of the basic electronics problem statement, we encountered a problem while running our 2 gate only circuit. Hence, we made a working simulation of a 4 gate circuit but we have also included the non-functional simulation of the 2 gate circuit  which we have perfectly implented on hardware, i.e, on breadboard.
